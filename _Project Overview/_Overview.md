# Setting Pitch
v2

The game takes place in a near-future, years after the Earth was been seeded with anomalous materiel and phenomena which have transformed the landscape.

The United States narrowly averted social collapse and what felt like the apocalypse, but still struggles to hold on as the comforts of an industrialized nation groan under the harassment of things beyond human comprehension.

Abiogenesis takes deep inspiration from the STALKER and Half Life Series,  Campaigns consist of enduring the social instability the products of this catastrophe bring and exploring this new, darker wilderness for the strange, the uncanny, the cool, and the pants shitting terror that has scarred the country.

For the player, the game is "your work commute includes an AR-15 in the emergency kit." The cities still hum with life, but they are vulnerable to the new wilderness. Internal refugees, adventurers and bandits are rife.

Gameplay can be described as a tactical adventure - taking cues from the modern gunfight and the empty battlefield. firearms, cover, concealment, and tactics are important. Traditional monsters of fantasy are difficult to fit into this type of gameplay, as melee attacks need advantages to outweigh the high lethality of modern weapons.

# Game engine - Why modify Reflex?

The Reflex system has the tools to fit the nature of a modern gunfight and survival.

- Manage long and short distance combat with range bands and rules for vision at actual firearm ranges

- dice system has competence baked into it - novice skill users are inconsistent while experts often clutch

- Margins of success reward shot placement and broaden the range of success and failure

- Tick based, original XCOM style Mexican Standoff initiative system for fast paced, highly violent fights: be the first to shoot!

- Operational actions broaden the behavior of gunfights between lulls of shooting

- Vehicle combat rules with damage by hit location

- Survival rules

- Detailed character generation rules (if necessary)
# Inspiration
## STALKER, Roadside picnic
Inspiration comes from the gameplay loop and the protagonist's situation as a hustler exploring for riches, along with the setting's modernity, lethality

Roadside picnic increases this by introducing the concept of cosmic litter seeding the planet with bizarre behavior.
## HP Lovecraft
Shadow over Innsmouth, The Color out of Space
## Half Life
anomalous events and monstrous aliens upend the immersive operations of a top secret government facility on the bleeding edge of scientific discovery.
## Annihilation
Cosmic horror and incomprehensible artifacts that are a significant enough danger to society that they need investigation
## Hellboy
Immersion into a mysterious world of occult detective work hidden behind potemkin normalcy
## X-Files
Immersion into solving the threats of paranormal activity that society is unequipped to handle 
## Still Wakes the Deep

#  Themes
## The State in Social Preservation mode
- [ ] rewrite required
Abiogenesis takes place in an setting of an averted apocalypse. All human society narrowly weathered an emergency of unimaginable scale at immense cost. Mammoth pools of resources and knowledge had to be redirected on the spot in response.

As of the moment, the government is saddled with the dual tasks of forming a National Recovery and an arrears of debts and losses it racked, in man, machine, and infrastructure. The end of federal social security, Rationing and conscription form the new normal as the Federal government pulls back from daily life to save for the unfulfilled National Recovery plans.

The landscape of post-de Kuiper America is littered with scrappy enterprises, liquidation startups, impoverished regulators and flimsy answers. It is a new age of the entrepreneur as many of economic champions or core pillars of the economy disappeared almost overnight.
## A nearly averted apocalypse
On the precipice of darkness and light; An oppressive, gothic environment is hidden just outside the borders of society

## Knowledge Gap
While the physical effects  of the de kuiper event was a baleful swan of tragedy, its repercussions have become far more disturbing for the future of human life on earth. In one brief instant of history, the gap between the human experience of the universe and understanding was torn apart in an unrecognizable mess of contradiction and the 'paranormal.''

The paranormal, defined as what science doesn't know, is now a common fact of life, swallowing so much of modern human existence in the darkness of scientific doubt. Wherever this spectre arises, the familiar is replaced by the alien, the safe rendered uncanny.
## Authentic, Hardened
When close to home, the world works similarly to our own and the stalkers get see a lot of its darker sides. Abuse, violence and physical injuries should be described just as horrifically as witnessing them in real life would be. Death and murder are serious things, just like in our world.

Even supernatural phenomena are studied from the viewpoint of natural science, not magic or religion. Even if the stalkers lack the scientific understanding of the researchers, their attitudes towards the phenomena and creatures of the Zone are usually very pragmatic.
### You Are Human
As weird as things get in the Zone, the player characters are still the protagonists with their actions and goals. The adventure may take them into the Zone but it is still a story about people, not the Zone. The causes and effects of their adventures are usually found on this side of the border.
## Threats and Disorder
Society exists perilously close to the border of darkness; outside its safety lie an threat to nations and peoples which cannot be underestimated. In extreme cases, failure is not optional.
### [Insecurity](Motivation)
Characters are responsible for making their own living, so the sustenance should weigh heavy on player's minds. See [[#Survival gameplay]]

Normal job opportunities are limited. in return, there's plenty of high risk, high reward jobs.
# Mechanical themes
## Combat patrol
- flavor of a Tarkov Raid
## Survival gameplay
Venturing to make a living or to better ones living
## endemic sustainment costs
constant stress from deficiency needs
## Medium-high lethality
- Character creation can help support gameplay with lots of backup or trickleback
- Lethality can be balanced for immediate consequence (lethal) or deep story (less lethal)
## Party requirements
- the party needs a hideout
# Subsettings
## Fear Country - demons and desperadoes
  
you're hustling out in Wild West just north of the remains of California, earning a living amongst the poor prospects and the things you lock your doors for.

Like Black Lagoon, basically.
## The Zone - Expeditions for forbidden riches and settling dark scores


## Case File - Emergency Investigation and Response

## Occult Grind - Hustles and Horror in Urban America
## Dark State - A tour of duty to hold back deep waters
# Definitions for success
For abio to be successful, we need to create a tabletop tactical adventure that can be described as stalker meets half life.

More precisely, we are creating a tabletop tactical adventure which takes the concepts of reality altering anomalous phenomena to intellectually immerse the player in the unnerving mysteries and dilemmas of a post disaster society. 

Additional goals:
- should test the feasibility of a tactical adventure
- should introduce the idea of the modern tactical adventure to non-k types
- use the reflex engine
- be interesting and fun for a modest population of tabletop enthusiasts
- contain lots of support to simplify play
- have original phenomena and behavior - this is *not* A setting for classic American paranormal tropes


- not expecting to make money
- not expecting a mainstream audience

---
Another definition for success would be to define the thematic tone through a concept delivered through text, visuals, and sound (like a title sequence).

Since there is no 'best' settled upon theme, we will instead refer to these as the in development examples, not final release
