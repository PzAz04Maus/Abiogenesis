# Incapacitation

A character who is incapacitated is unable to act.

When a character reaches maximum trauma, they are incapacitated.
If a character receives a critical hit, they must roll a resolve test or be incapacitated.

# Instability

Major trauma requires critical care within a certain time period for a good prognosis, which can be extended by stabilization. Failure to apply critical care in this time period results in a poor prognosis.

**Good prognosis**: A character with a good prognosis eventually returns to the campaign.

**Poor prognosis**: A poor medical outcome means the character is permanently removed from play in the campaign, either through death or extreme disability.

## Injury
### Shock
Whenever a character suffers a moderate 
injury, the player must succeed in a Fitness check or the character 
enters shock.  If the margin of failure is greater than 5, the character 
also becomes unstable.

Whenever a character suffers a serious 
injury, the player must succeed in a Fitness check or the character 
enters shock.  If the margin of failure is greater than 5, the character 
also becomes unstable.

A critically injured character automatically 
enters shock.  In addition, the player must succeed in a Fitness check 
or the character becomes unstable.

---

When a character enters shock, his body is beginning to shut 
down in an attempt to deal with what it perceives as catastrophic 
trauma.  A character who enters shock is unable to act for the rest 
of the current exchange of fire.  For the remainder of the scene, 
any effect that would put the character into shock instead renders 
him unstable.

At the beginning of each subsequent exchange of fire, before 
initiative is rolled, the player must succeed in a CUF check.  If this 
check succeeds, the character may act normally during the next 
exchange of fire.  If the check fails, the character is semiconscious 
and may take no tactical actions.

### Instability

An unstable character is experiencing significant bleeding 
or other persistent and immediate degradation of his physical 
condition.  At the end of each **subsequent full exchange of fire or** 
**pause (or one full minute, in a non-combat situation)**, every hit 
location that is injured becomes one level worse. Uninjured hit 
locations don’t degrade.  This cycle continues until a hit location 
that is already critically injured becomes one level worse, at which 
point the character bleeds out and is clinically dead.

If a character becomes unstable as a result of a head injury, 
he also instantly becomes unconscious and remains so for the rest 
of the scene.

Example: Pete becomes unstable.  He has slight injuries to his 
left arm and left leg, a moderate injury to his head, and a serious 
injury to his torso.  At the end of the next pause or exchange of fire, 
Pete’s left arm and left leg will degrade to moderately injured, his 
head will degrade to seriously injured, and his torso will degrade 
to critically injured.  At the end of the following pause or exchange 
of fire, Pete will bleed out from his critical torso injury.

In anticipation of the need to save characters’ lives, players 
are advised to become familiar with the first aid rules (see p. 174).
## Care
### Stabilization
Invariably, some humanitarian characters will not wish to 
allow their unstable comrades to bleed to death in the middle of 
combat. Stabilizing an unstable patient requires a Render Aid 
operational action (or one minute outside combat) and a Medicine 
(COG, TN +2) skill check.

With success, the patient is stabilized and no longer suffers 
the continued wound degradation of instability.  If the check fails 
with a margin of failure of 4 or less, the patient is not stabilized but 
does not degrade at the end of that exchange of fire.

Example: Pete sustains a critical torso injury, a moderate left 
leg injury, and a slight left arm injury from a burst of automatic 
fire. He becomes unstable and begins bleeding out. Erin, not 
wanting to go to the effort of digging another grave, attempts to 
stabilize Pete.  Her total penalty is –4: –3 from the critical torso 
injury and –1 from the moderate leg injury.
## Resuscitation
A character who has bled out has one final chance at survival: 
resuscitation.  This must occur within a total number of exchanges 
of fire and pauses (or minutes if outside combat) equal to the 
recently deceased character’s Resolve value.  Resuscitation requires 
a Render Aid operational action (or 1d6 minutes outside combat) 
and a Medicine (RES, TN –2) skill check.  This task suffers the same 
penalties as stabilization, but also suffers a cumulative –1 penalty for 
each pause, exchange of fire, or minute that has passed since death.

A successful resuscitation attempt returns the patient to life 
in an unstable condition with the injuries he had upon expiration. 
If he is not subsequently stabilized, he will die (again).  He remains 
in shock and unconscious for the remainder of the scene.

Example: Erin’s stabilization attempt fails and Pete’s heart 
stops.  Pete has Resolve 4, so Erin has a total of 4 exchanges of fire 
and pauses (or 4 minutes) before Pete is brain dead.  She immedi-
ately initiates resuscitation procedures.  Her total penalty to her 
first attempt is –4: –3 from the critical torso injury and –1 from 
the moderate leg injury.
