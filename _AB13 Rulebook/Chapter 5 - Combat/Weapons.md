# Tip: Shooting at elevated targets
To find the direct distance of a target that is at a vertical incline or decline to the shooter, add half the shortest leg of the triangle to the longer leg of the triangle.

# Automatic Fire
if the attacker obtains a success on his attack test, the number of bullets for which he rolls to see if it hit or not is limited to his margin of success, up to the maximum equal to the number of bullets.

Roll 1d[MARGIN]. The result is how many additional hits occur in %. So if the result is 5, then 50% of the rounds hit.
# Alt: percentage based

~~roll a 1d10 - the number of range bands out of optimal range~~

# Recoil
All firearms are subject to recoil, the momentum that the explosion of a cartridge’s propellant imparts to the gun.
For the shooter, the primary effect of recoil is to jerk the gun off-target, which makes rapid subsequent shots more difficult.
Any weapon with a Recoil value is subject to the following rules.

# Single shot

All weapons have a recoil value. When a character shoots a firearm, the character's *next* action suffers that penalty.

The recoil penalty doesn't apply to an aimed shot.
# Burst fire

When a character fires a burst attack, add the number of rounds in the burst to the recoil penalty ~~and apply it to the *current* attack.~~ 
# Armor
## Candidate 1
Subtract the armor value from the total damage value. If the result is zero or less, the attack fails.

# Penetration
Penetration reduces the effective armor value. Overpenetration adds no additional damage

~~Penetration: The base Penetration value of any attack made with the weapon. Non-explosive ranged weapons have two Penetration values.  The first is for attacks made at optimum range or closer, and the second is for attacks made past optimum range.  This trait is not listed for explosives - see the explosion rules in Chapter Five for details.~~
## Stage III Candidate: Overpenetration
Penetration in excess of armor reduces the final damage total.

# Stage III Candidate: 
## Armor Ballistics
pen and armor are by values of 10, with fractions.

if the pen equals or exceeds the armor, the round penetrates

if the pen is below the armor by a factor of less than 10, roll 1d10 and add to pen. if pen equals or exceeds armor, the round penetrates.

~~add margin of success to pen value~~

~~use side die for pen value~~
