# Setting Pitch
v2

The game takes place in a near-future, years after the Earth was been seeded with anomalous materiel and phenomena which have transformed the landscape.

The United States narrowly averted social collapse and what felt like the apocalypse, but still struggles to hold on as the comforts of an industrialized nation groan under the harassment of things beyond human comprehension.

Abiogenesis takes deep inspiration from the STALKER and Half Life Series,  Campaigns consist of enduring the social instability the products of this catastrophe bring and exploring this new, darker wilderness for the strange, the uncanny, the cool, and the pants shitting terror that has scarred the country.

For the player, the game is "your work commute includes an AR-15 in the emergency kit." The cities still hum with life, but they are vulnerable to the new wilderness. Internal refugees, adventurers and bandits are rife.

Gameplay can be described as a tactical adventure - taking cues from the modern gunfight and the empty battlefield. firearms, cover, concealment, and tactics are important. Traditional monsters of fantasy are difficult to fit into this type of gameplay, as melee attacks need advantages to outweigh the high lethality of modern weapons.

# Game engine - Why modify Reflex?

The Reflex system has the tools to fit the nature of a modern gunfight and survival.

- Manage long and short distance combat with range bands and rules for vision at actual firearm ranges

- dice system has competence baked into it - novice skill users are inconsistent while experts often clutch

- Margins of success reward shot placement and broaden the range of success and failure

- Tick based, original XCOM style Mexican Standoff initiative system for fast paced, highly violent fights: be the first to shoot!

- Operational actions broaden the behavior of gunfights between lulls of shooting

- Vehicle combat rules with damage by hit location

- Survival rules

- Detailed character generation rules (if necessary)

# Subsettings
## Fear Country - demons and desperadoes
  
you're hustling out in Wild West just north of the remains of California, earning a living amongst the poor prospects and the things you lock your doors for.

Like Black Lagoon, basically.
## The Zone - Expeditions for forbidden riches and settling dark scores


## Case File - Emergency Investigation and Response

## Occult Grind - Hustles and Horror in Urban America
## Dark State - A tour of duty to hold back deep waters
# Definitions for success
For abio to be successful, we need to create a tabletop tactical adventure that can be described as stalker meets half life.

More precisely, we are creating a tabletop tactical adventure which takes the concepts of reality altering anomalous phenomena to intellectually immerse the player in the unnerving mysteries and dilemmas of a post disaster society. 

Additional goals:
- should test the feasibility of a tactical adventure
- should introduce the idea of the modern tactical adventure to non-k types
- use the reflex engine
- be interesting and fun for a modest population of tabletop enthusiasts
- contain lots of support to simplify play
- have original phenomena and behavior - this is *not* A setting for classic American paranormal tropes


- not expecting to make money
- not expecting a mainstream audience

---
Another definition for success would be to define the thematic tone through a concept delivered through text, visuals, and sound (like a title sequence).

Since there is no 'best' settled upon theme, we will instead refer to these as the in development examples, not final release
